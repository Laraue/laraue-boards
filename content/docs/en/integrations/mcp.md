Laraue Boards runs a remote **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) server, so an AI agent like Claude can work with your issues directly — listing them, opening one, moving it between statuses, or leaving a comment — without you copying anything back and forth by hand.

## What you need

An [API key](/en/documentation/integrations/api-keys) for the organization you want Claude to access. Create one from **Account → API keys** before connecting.

## Connecting in Claude

In Claude, type `/mcp` to open the MCP connectors list, then choose the **custom connector** option and add:

- **URL**: `https://boards.laraue.com/boards-mcp/mcp`
- **Header**: `X-Api-Key` set to your API key

Laraue Boards is also listed on the [official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) as `com.laraue/boards`, so any other MCP-compatible client that can browse the registry can find it the same way.

## What Claude can do

Every action runs with your own permissions, live — Claude can't do anything in an organization that you couldn't do yourself there, and it can't act at all once the API key behind it is revoked.

- **Issues** — list and filter issues, view one in full detail, create a new one (with a title), edit its title, content or assignee, move it to a different status, or delete it
- **Comments** — add a comment to an issue, or edit one you wrote
- **Organization structure** — look up spaces, statuses, custom attributes, and members, so Claude can resolve names to the right ids on its own
- **Attachments** — download an image attached to an issue

Claude only offers actions you're actually allowed to take — for example, it won't suggest deleting an issue in a space where you don't have delete permission.

## Revoking access

Access is tied entirely to the API key. Revoke it from **Account → API keys** at any time, and Claude immediately loses the ability to reach that organization — the same as revoking any other key.
